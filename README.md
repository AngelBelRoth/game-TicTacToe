# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates core front-end skills: layout design, DOM manipulation, and state management.
Bonus: Includes a refactor from JavaScript array-based board to an **object-based game state** for more efficient access and updates.
